## Technical Highlights

### Dark Mode Implementation

```typescript
// ThemeProvider with localStorage persistence
export function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>("light")

  useEffect(() => {
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme") as Theme | null
    const systemPreference = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches ? "dark" : "light"

    const initialTheme = savedTheme || systemPreference
    setTheme(initialTheme)

    if (initialTheme === "dark") {
      document.documentElement.classList.add("dark")
    }
  }, [])

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const newTheme = theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"
    setTheme(newTheme)
    localStorage.setItem("theme", newTheme)
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark")
  }

  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>...</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

### Bulk Operations Pattern

```typescript
// Efficient selection tracking
const [selectedJobIds, setSelectedJobIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())

// Parallel API calls for bulk operations
await Promise.all(Array.from(selectedJobIds).map((id) => fetch(`/api/jobs/${id}`, { method: "DELETE" })))
```

### Calendar Date Logic

```typescript
// Get jobs for specific date (checks applied date + deadline)
const getJobsForDate = (date: Date | null) => {
  if (!date) return []

  return jobs.filter((job) => {
    const appliedDate = new Date(job.appliedDate)
    const deadline = job.deadline ? new Date(job.deadline) : null

    const isSameDay = (d1: Date, d2: Date) => {
      return d1.getDate() === d2.getDate() && d1.getMonth() === d2.getMonth() && d1.getFullYear() === d2.getFullYear()
    }

    return isSameDay(appliedDate, date) || (deadline && isSameDay(deadline, date))
  })
}
```
