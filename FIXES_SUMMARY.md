# Bug Fixes - October 9, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Export Button Not Working

**Problem:**

- Hover-based dropdown was unreliable
- Menu disappeared when trying to move cursor to it
- Not clear what was being exported
- Clicking button did nothing

**Solution:**

- Changed from hover-based to **click-based dropdown**
- Added click-outside handler to close menu
- Clear labeling: **"Export All Jobs (X)"**
- Larger menu with descriptions:
  - 📊 CSV Format (Excel/Sheets)
  - 📄 JSON Format (Complete data)
  - Cancel button
- Shows count of jobs being exported
- Menu closes after selection

**Changes:**

- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - New click-based export menu with state management

---

### 2. ✅ Next.js 15 Params Warning

**Problem:**

```
Warning: A param property was accessed directly with `params.id`.
params is now a Promise and should be unwrapped with `React.use()`
```

**Solution:**

- Updated to Next.js 15 pattern
- Changed `params: { id: string }` to `params: Promise<{ id: string }>`
- Used `React.use()` to unwrap params:
  ```tsx
  const { id } = use(params)
  ```
- Replaced all `params.id` references with `id`

**Changes:**

- `app/dashboard/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated params handling

1. Open browser console
