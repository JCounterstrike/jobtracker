## Step 6: Integration with Your Portfolio Site

### Option 1: Direct Repository Link

Add to your portfolio:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jobtracker"> View Source Code on GitHub </a>
```

### Option 2: Embed GitHub Card

Use GitHub's embed functionality or services like:

- [GitHub Repo Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/)
