## 📝 Notes for Developers

### Adding More Chart Types

The analytics page uses `recharts`. To add more visualizations:

```tsx
import { AreaChart, Area } from "recharts"

// Then use like LineChart
;<AreaChart data={yourData}>
  <Area dataKey="value" stroke="#color" fill="#color" />
</AreaChart>
```

### Extending Export Formats

See `lib/export.ts` - easy to add new formats like:

- PDF reports
- Excel with formatting
- Markdown summaries
- HTML tables

### Adding New Search Fields

In `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, update the filter function:

```tsx
const filteredJobs = jobs.filter((job) => {
  const searchLower = searchQuery.toLowerCase()
  return (
    job.company.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) || job.position.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) || job.notes?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) // Add this
  )
})
```
