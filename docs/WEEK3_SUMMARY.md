   - `POST /api/jobs/[id]/suggestions` - Generate tailoring suggestions
   - Enhanced `/api/resumes/upload` - Now generates embeddings automatically

4. **Enhanced UI** (`app/dashboard/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Interactive AI Resume Matching panel
   - Resume selector dropdown
   - One-click match calculation
   - Visual progress bar with color coding (green/yellow/orange)
   - AI suggestions display with formatted output
   - Loading states for async operations

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1️⃣ Enable pgvector in Supabase

**CRITICAL STEP:** You must do this before the app will work!

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Run this command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

### 2️⃣ Add OpenAI API Key

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your-key-here"
```

Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 3️⃣ Push Database Schema

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 4️⃣ Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing the AI Features

### Quick Test Flow

1. **Upload a Resume**

   - Go to `/dashboard/resumes`
   - Upload a PDF or DOCX
   - ✅ Embedding is generated automatically

2. **Create a Job Application**

   - Add a new job with a detailed description
   - Save it

3. **Calculate Match Score**

   - Open the job details
   - Select a resume from the dropdown
   - Click "Calculate Match"
   - ✅ See the match percentage (0-100%)

4. **Get AI Suggestions**
   - After calculating match, click "Get AI Tailoring Suggestions"
   - ✅ See 3-5 actionable recommendations

## 💰 Cost Estimates

**Per Resume Upload:**

- Embedding generation: ~$0.00002
- Storage: Free (pgvector)

**Per Match Calculation:**

- Resume embedding: $0 (cached)
- Job embedding: ~$0.00001 (cached after first time)
- Similarity calculation: $0 (local computation)

**Per AI Suggestion:**

- GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.001-0.002

**Total per job application (match + suggestions): ~$0.002** 💸

## 🎯 How It Works

### The AI Pipeline

```
Resume Upload
    ↓
Extract Text (PDF/DOCX)
    ↓
Generate Embedding → [1536-dim vector]
    ↓
Store in Database (pgvector)

Job Description
    ↓
Generate Embedding → [1536-dim vector]
    ↓
Calculate Cosine Similarity with Resume
    ↓
Convert to Match Score (0-100%)
    ↓
If requested: Generate GPT Suggestions
```

### Match Score Interpretation

- **80-100%** 🟢 Excellent match (green bar)
- **60-79%** 🟡 Good match, room for improvement (yellow bar)
- **0-59%** 🟠 Consider tailoring (orange bar)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "type 'vector' does not exist"

**Solution:** Enable pgvector extension in Supabase (see step 1 above)

### "Failed to generate embedding"

**Check:**

- Is `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`?
- Do you have credits in your OpenAI account?
- Restart the dev server after adding the key

### Match score seems inaccurate

**Note:**

- Embeddings capture semantic meaning, not keywords
- Generic resumes score lower
- More detailed job descriptions = better matching
